# pitch-predict
Prediction for pitch sequencing


### TODO:
- Get at-bats into numpy arrays
- Data exploration
- Feature engineering
- Get to format to put into an RNN
- Get output, compare against benchmarks
    - ROC curve
    - Benchmark against random guessing
    - Benchmark against simpler method? (MCMC?)


### Future Work:
- Consider non-RNN solutions (trees?)
- Consider non-K outcomes
